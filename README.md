# Reshum_Extract_rotation_outlook
Reshum is HR database and I will extract data from it and push it in outlook calendar.
Work system in company 4x4 means that employees work for 4 weeks 7AM-7PM and after go for 4 weeks on holidays.
In this application I will extract rotation schedule from Reshum and push it in outlook calendat and allow employees to modify their rotation
with approval of thier Manager and after Manager give his approval employee can make rotation change request and should be also approuved 
by director and send to HR for execution.
Employees have right to do 2 changes a year and can have permission from HR to do more, when create change request the Managers can see how many
times this employee request change in the same year, if employee reach number of times allowed the employee sholud have the permission of 
HR Dept first, if so on he can make his request with a same procedure.
